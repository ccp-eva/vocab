# CLT word selection guidelines

### 1. Target words and distractors should come from the same semantic category

#### Semantic categories

Nouns:

* animate natural kinds (e.g. butterfly, frog, tiger)
* inanimate natural kinds (e.g. cucumber, cloud, leaf)
* and artefacts (e.g. drum, lamp, snowman)

Verbs: 

* physical actions performed by humans (e.g. to laugh, to paint, to peel)
* actions performed by animals (e.g. to bark, to hatch, to sting)
* states or unintentional actions (e.g. to boil, to drip, to rain)

### 2. Targets and distractors should have the same rated age of acquisition

### 3. Targets and distractors should have the same complexity index (CI)

Complexity index is computed based on the formula below. Each component of the formula is rated by an expert linguist for a language. 

`CI = L + SLP + B + D + S + P + E + F + I + InitC + InterC`

with:

* `L` means being a recent loanword (1 point if the word is a loanword, 0 if it is not)
* `SLP` means doubled standardised length in phonemes in a given language, calculated separately for nouns and verbs5
* `B` means number of roots (consequently, more than 1 point for the compound words)
* `D` means being a derived word (1 point if the word is derived, 0 if it is not)
* `S`, `P` means suffixes and prefixes (1 point for each suffix and prefix)
* `E` means exposure to the referent (0 point if the object/action is available to children based on direct experience in a given culture, 1 point if it is not)
* `F` means subjective frequency of exposure (0.5 or 1 point for rare^objects, 0 for common ones)
* `T` means initial frication (1 point if the word begins with frication, 0 if it does not)
* `InitC` means initial consonant clusters (I point if the word begins with a consonant cluster)
* `InterC` means internal consonant clusters (1 point if the word contains a consonant cluster)


Hint from the spreadsheet: 

> Remember that your distractors do not have to match your targets exactly! If there is no words enough in a difficulty category to select 8 targets for production, 8 targets for comprehension and 16 distractors for comprehension, you can choose distractors from other category of difficulty. However, the production and comprehension targets should come from the same category and the same semantic domain.
